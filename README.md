Telling Stories with Data Portfolio

# About me:
I'm a second year MSPPM DA student at Heinz. Before that, I had a large background in nonprofit work. Excited to be here!

# What I hope to learn
Strong visual decision-making skills (what to best depict information, how to format it, what best practices to follow)
Some Tableau
I hope to pursue a career in public sector consulting and having the ability to communicate information and data effectively to teams and clients are crucial for putting forward successful, data-driven work.
