## Description
The first visual with the bar chart was difficult to read due to the labeling and inconsistent coloring. It was difficult to derive much meaning when the colors did not indicate how to feel about each country's value. Seeing more neutral colors and the order being decending made it seem as though the countries with the most debt were doing well if I didn't read the labels thoroughly. The second visual did color code the scale based on the level of debt which made it easier to read, however the amount of numbers visible made it feel overwhelming to read. The data that was missing from some countries also stood out and my eyes were drawn to the white spaces, which distracted from the data that was supposed to be read.

For the third visualization, I made a line graph that compares countries' debt-to-GDP ratio over time, and decided that it would work best in a way that compares trends between them. In this case, I narrowed down the scope of my visualization for consistency, so I picked out countries in Eastern Europe. Of these, I noticed something interesting among them that showed how Estonia had a consistently stable economy whereas its neighboring countries would fluctuate at similar rates. Noticing this, I decided to make the visual focused on Estonia, so I grayed out the other countries and highlighted Estonia's line in Green to give it a positive tone. I also labeled the title to be more explicit of what the visual is representing as well as the scope of the data being in Eastern Europe.
