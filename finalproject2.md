# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project. 

When developing the storyboard for my topic, I knew that I wanted to touch on four major points: The current turnover rate in DC, breaking down DC into their respective Wards, introducing DC's current solution to the problem via the IMPACT Program, and looking at the differences in turnover rates by ward as well as other adverse factors such as average class sizes. One of the trickiest things I had to grapple with is where I should stop showing the numbers and data for DCPS and start putting in the context of how DCPS is tackling the issue. I believed at first that I should introduce it in the middle of the storyboard to put it into context later with my visualizations how it's approach for providing bonuses to high performing educators can unfairly assess educator's that have far more disadvantages in earning the scores necessary to gain a bonus through the program. However, I thought it would work better to have the audience see the program towards the end, after already understanding the extent of disparities that exist between some schools that aren't well off compared to others. That way, when I introduce the IMPACT program in my story, the audience almost already can put together that this program is fundamentally not accounting for the schools that they've just seen need help. So with that, I developed my storyboard:
